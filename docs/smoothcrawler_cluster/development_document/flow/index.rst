Flow

For understanding how a crawler cluster run well, it's a great idea of explaining it with some clear work flow. This section
would explain the details of how one or more group(s) of crawlers could run finely with each others as a cluster.

It divides this part to 2 sections because the cluster working could be demonstrated in 2 different ways, one is the general
way --- how it work finely, so explain it with **work flow**; but it also could be explain with the data changing in cluster
working --- how it work finely with the meta-data, so also could explain it with **data flow**.

Please refer to below 2 sections: **Work Flow** and **Data Flow** to get more details:
