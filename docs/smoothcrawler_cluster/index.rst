*A Python package which is encapsulation of high fault tolerance features for building cluster or distributed crawler system with *SmoothCrawler*.*


Overview
----------

Do you ever been troubled how to develop a high fault tolerance program of crawler? In generally, crawler must gets fails or other
weired issues so that occur any exceptions in running for a while because the Font-End code always be changed (no matter for new
feature, breaking change or against web spider ðŸ«£ ). So about the *SmoothCrawler*, it targets to separating the different concerns
to different objects to let every components could focus on what thing they should and only to do; about the *SmoothCrawler-Cluster*,
it extends the SoC features as a distributed or cluster system further, it gives crawler has high fault tolerance feature!

However, we could develop a high fault tolerance crawler easily. Let's demonstrate an example to show how easy and clear it is!

.. code-block:: python

   from smoothcrawler_cluster import ZookeeperCrawler

   # Instantiate some crawlers with Zookeeper
   zk_crawler = ZookeeperCrawler(runner=2,
                                 backup=1,
                                 ensure_initial=True,
                                 zk_hosts=_ZK_HOSTS)
   # Same as SmoothCrawler general usage, register the components into factory
   zk_crawler.register_factory(http_req_sender=RequestsHTTPRequest(),
                               http_resp_parser=RequestsExampleHTTPResponseParser(),
                               data_process=ExampleDataHandler())
   # Listen and wait for tasks
   zk_crawler.run()
